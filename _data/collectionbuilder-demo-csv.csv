demo06,,https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/m0cfxpz3,Indigurrito,record,"Nao Bustamante (www.naobustamante.com) is an internationally known performance artist born in California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. She has performed in galleries, museums, universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. She is currently teaching New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. 'Indigurrito' is Bustamante's contribution to the many performances that commemorated the 500 anniversary of the conquest of America. The title mixes the term 'indigenous' with 'burrito', the name of the famous Mexican wrap. In the performance, Bustamante challenged the white men in the audience to go onstage to express their apologies for the years of oppression of indigenous peoples by eating a piece of a burrito that Bustamante had strapped on to her hips. With humor and sarcasm, Bustamante addressed the issues that the 500-year commemoration brought to collective attention. Her piece also denounces how art institutions forced artists to pay tribute to the date if they wanted to get funding.",Nao Bustamante,1992,"America -- Discovery and exploration; Indigenous peoples; Columbus Quincentenary, 1992-1993; Hispanic American artists; Discoveries in geography; Performance art; Revisionist history; Conquest; Oppression; Latino artists; Performance; Political performance",,,,m0cfxpz3,,Image;MovingImage,en,"Copyright holder: Nao Bustamante, Contact information: nao@naobustamante.com, http://www.naobustamante.com ",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,,,
